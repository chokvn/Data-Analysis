# Data-Analysis

Data analysis performed on datasets can be found here as examples for demonstrating machine learning techniques. The projects are organized by data and Python notebook files are named according to technique.

Currently, only Python data analysis have been uploaded. However, similar analyses will be uploaded in R.

A small summary for each of the projects uploaded can be found below:
1) Car Evaluation
  - kfold cross validation of techniques
  - classifier and regression tree (CART) analyis of dataset
